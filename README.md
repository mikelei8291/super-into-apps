# Super Into Apps

Get into the apps directly with just the Super button.

This is a fork of [Start Overlay in Application View for Gnome 40+](https://github.com/Hexcz/Start-Overlay-in-Application-View-for-Gnome-40-) that removes any unrelated functionalities, namely Hexcz/Start-Overlay-in-Application-View-for-Gnome-40-#12.

This fork only changes the behavior of the Super key, nothing more.

## Installation

```fish
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
git clone https://github.com/mikelei8291/super-into-apps.git
```

Logout and login again, then enable the extension in the extension manager.
